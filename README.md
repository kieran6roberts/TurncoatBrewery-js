# Turncoat Brewery - Mock Brewery Site

This is a site built for a mock brewery and includes a home, products and contact pages as well as a small e-commerce store. The client-side of the app is built using vanilla JS and CSS while the server-side code uses Node.js to build a simple express server and connect to mongoose which stores my products.

## Project Objectives

The aim of this project was to build a full, responsive and fluid site for a ficticious brewing company that included an e-commerce store as the main feature and so I could include the project in my portfolio. Having only just began to learn Node.js I wanted to write a simple server using express and connect it to a database that could store my own custom products without having to reach for a large CMS. I also wanted to practice with another templating language after trying Handlebars so for this project I used EJS. Finally, on the frontend the use of a large framework was not required for this task and I wanted to improve my javascript through building the store functionality.

* CSS3
